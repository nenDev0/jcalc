- Java
- Tests
- a... few bugs. :)

- promises for your eyes and brain to function after reading the code

### Requirements

- Java
- JUnit with Hamcrest-Core (included in .lib)


### Future Development

- I make no promises of continuing development on this project
- Any future features currently within reach are added to the git issues page

feel free to assist me in my effort


## Sidenotes (Don't @ me about these)

- For my personal projects, I make my own Coding Rules. I can simply read it better that way

## Github Usage

### Git Issues

Git Issues are the way any future features, improvements, bugs, etc. are documented. As they get implemented the issues are subsequently closed.

### Branches

- developmemt:
any development, currently going on in separate components, will be finalized here before a merge with the main branch


## Code Notes

Before you start reading or messing with the code, these notes may help you understand some things.

- Exceptions are mostly not handled:
Exceptions are mostly not handled, since any errors in the code will lead to it being unplayable anyways.
They should ideally not happen in the first place, as that would point towards an issue in the code.
- TODOs are questions/issues which may already exist as Git Issues. They're sometimes used to simply keep something in mind, in case it may be necessary information later.
